# Recipe_Website
Recipe Website done for Odin

This is a project to test out my current HTML skills, as at 13/07/2023,
one day after I first started to learn HTML. I will come back to this
project once I have taught myself some CSS to make the website look 
prettier.

My aim in this project is to demonstrate basic HTML skills, such as creating 
text paragraphs, headings, embedding pictures and linking to other webpages.
